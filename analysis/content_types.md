# Analysis of Blocked Content Types

Based on the comprehensive data collected from Freedom House, Access Now, OONI/iMAP, NetBlocks, and Top10VPN, this analysis categorizes the types of content most frequently blocked or censored globally during 2024.

## Social Media Platforms

Social media platforms continue to be primary targets for censorship and blocking worldwide. According to the Freedom House 2024 report, social media blocking occurred in at least 21 of the 41 countries that held elections during the coverage period, often to suppress opposition voices and limit organizing capabilities.

Key platforms frequently targeted:
- Twitter/X
- Facebook
- Instagram
- YouTube
- TikTok
- Telegram

The Access Now #KeepItOn report documented that platform-specific blocks, rather than complete internet shutdowns, have become increasingly common as governments attempt more targeted censorship approaches. This allows for more precise control while maintaining plausible deniability about complete network disruptions.

OONI/iMAP's regional analysis shows that in Asia, Telegram was particularly targeted during 2024, with new blocks detected in multiple countries including Myanmar, India, and Vietnam.

## News and Political Content

Independent news sites and political opposition content faced severe restrictions globally:

- Freedom House documented that in three-quarters of the countries covered, internet users faced arrest for nonviolent expression, often related to political criticism
- News websites were among the most commonly blocked categories in all nine countries studied by OONI/iMAP
- During election periods, news site blocking increased by an average of 43% according to NetBlocks data

Specific types of news/political content most frequently blocked:
1. Independent journalism platforms
2. Opposition political party websites
3. Election monitoring organizations
4. Human rights documentation sites
5. Diaspora news sources

## National Security Content

Content categorized as threatening "national security" saw increased blocking:

- Governments increasingly cited national security concerns to justify censorship
- Encryption and privacy tools (VPNs, secure messaging) faced new restrictions
- Myanmar's military regime imposed a new censorship system specifically targeting VPNs
- China continued aggressive blocking of international traffic to government websites and imposed large fines on VPN users

## Other Significant Categories

### Academic and Research Content
- Scientific research on sensitive topics
- Academic freedom platforms
- International educational resources

### LGBTQ+ Content
- LGBTQ+ community resources
- Health information
- Rights organizations

### Religious and Ethnic Minority Content
- Minority religious websites
- Cultural preservation resources
- Ethnic minority language content

## Regional Variations

The data shows significant regional variations in content blocking patterns:

- **Middle East/North Africa**: Highest rates of political and news content blocking
- **Asia Pacific**: Most aggressive in blocking VPNs and encryption tools
- **Sub-Saharan Africa**: Increasing social media blocks, particularly during elections and protests
- **Europe**: Growing platform-specific blocks, though less comprehensive than other regions
- **Americas**: Targeted blocking of specific opposition voices rather than wholesale platform blocks

## Emerging Trends

1. **Exam-related shutdowns**: Kenya, Iraq, and several other countries implemented targeted platform blocks specifically during national examination periods
2. **"Splinternet" fragmentation**: China, Russia, and Turkey continued developing isolated national internets with comprehensive content restrictions
3. **Generative AI restrictions**: New regulations emerged limiting AI tools during election periods
4. **Cross-border censorship**: Increasing instances of one country's censorship affecting neighboring nations

This categorization will inform the development of visualizations showing regional patterns, platform-specific blocking, and temporal trends related to elections and protests.
